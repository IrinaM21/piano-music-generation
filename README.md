# piano-music-generation

This is a project I created for school.

I followed this tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5. The original code can be found here: https://github.com/Skuldur/Classical-Piano-Composer.

The changes I made include:
- Updating certain lines of code to work with TensorFlow 2
- Fine-tuning the model to generate music using the MAESTRO dataset
- Creating a script that makes simple midi files I used to test train.py and develop a strategy for fine-tuning the model
